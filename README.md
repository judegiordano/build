# build

Official build pipeline for [swift.cloud](https://swift.cloud)

## Motivation

This is a core part of Swift Cloud so one might wonder why we decided to open-source this project.

This project is the only part of our stack that has access to your source code. Given the immense amount of responsibility this project holds, we felt it was only right to show you exactly how we interact with your code.

This also allows the community to contribute back to the project if they feel its doing something it shouldn't or doing something in a less than ideal manner.
